# **Hey, I'm Haiden** 👋

## **Technical Product Leader | AI Systems | IoT Architecture | B2B SaaS**

Product leader with 7+ years of experience building mission-critical platforms from 0→1. I architect IoT systems, develop AI/ML solutions, and scale digital platforms that deliver measurable impact.

## **Tech Expertise**
* 🧠 **AI Orchestration:** Designing agentic workflows and AI-enabled processes that leverage LLMs, voice interfaces, and autonomous systems for practical applications
* 🤖 **AI Integration:** Implementing multi-modal AI technologies (voice, text, image processing) across platforms and creating seamless user experiences
* 🔧 **IoT Architecture:** Designing resilient systems for environmental monitoring with real-time alerts (92% delivery accuracy)
* 🚀 **SaaS Platform Development:** Scaling B2B platforms that drive significant user growth (850% increase) and revenue ($1.5M+ annually)
* 📊 **Data-Driven Innovation:** Creating frameworks that improve user activation by 255% through systematic experimentation

## **Featured AI & Prototype Projects**
* **[Synthia Dementia Voice AI](https://github.com/heyhaiden/synthia-dementia-voice-ai)**: Voice-assisted AI training companion for healthcare workers working with dementia and Alzheimer's patients
* **[Note Self Self](https://github.com/heyhaiden/note-self-self)**: Self-reflection tool that uses genAI to analyze anonymous user submissions into abstract illustrative artworks
* **[Firewall Scout](https://github.com/heyhaiden/firewall-dissertation)**: IoT microclimate monitoring system using ML algorithms to detect and predict fire threats, deployed across multiple UK regions
* **[HighAR Ground](https://devpost.com/software/highar-ground)**: Award-winning AR platform for disaster preparedness (MIT Reality Virtually Hackathon Winner) that visualizes evacuation routes and safety information

## **Innovation Approach**
I specialize in rapidly prototyping concepts, developing proof-of-concepts into production-ready systems, and creating user-centric solutions backed by data. My experience spans healthcare tech (voice AI for dementia patients), personal wellbeing applications, environmental monitoring, and disaster management systems.
